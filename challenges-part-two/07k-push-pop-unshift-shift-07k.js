let largeCountries = ["Tuvalu","India","USA","Indonesia","Monaco"]

// You need to help me fixup the largeCountries array so that 
// China and Pakistan are added back into their respective places


// Use push() & pop() and their counterparts unshift() & shift()
// Google how to use unshift() and shift()

//Explanation:
// push() adds object to end of array. pop() removes object from end of array
// unshift() adds object to start of array. shift() removes object from end of array
